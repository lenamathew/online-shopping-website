# Images Folder

This folder is for storing product images and other media assets.

## Usage

You can add product images here and reference them in your products like:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Product Name",
  image: "images/product1.jpg"
}
```

## Note

Currently, the project uses placeholder images from https://via.placeholder.com for demonstration purposes.

For production, replace these with actual product images stored in this folder.
